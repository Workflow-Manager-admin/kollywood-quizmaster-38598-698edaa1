# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Important Note: Babel Configuration

This project’s `package.json` includes a `babel` section with a plugin:

```json
"babel": {
"plugins": ["./.ve/babel-plugin-jsx-editor-id.js"]
}
```

This plugin enables **visual editing functionality** in supported tools.

**Warning for AI code agents and contributors:**
**DO NOT** remove or modify this section - it is ESSENTIAL for proper operation.
Removing it will break editor integration and visual editing features.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser or externally (see instructions below).

---

### Remote/Cloud Access (No 'Invalid Host header' errors!)

If you want to access the app from a remote URL/domain (e.g., `vscode-internal-82962-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3000`) in the browser:

**The following configuration is already set up for you:**
- The development server is started with `HOST=0.0.0.0` and the appropriate flags `--host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check`.
- An `.env` file with `HOST=0.0.0.0` is present.

**All you have to do:**
- Run
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  from inside the `kollywood_quizmaster/` directory.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you still see 'Invalid Host header':
  1. Ensure you are using the correct port and domain (matching the start output, e.g. `:3000`).
  2. Make sure the `.env` file is present with `HOST=0.0.0.0` (already included, but double-check).
  3. Try running `HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start` directly if necessary.

**You should now be able to access the app from any remote/cloud host without host header errors.**

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
